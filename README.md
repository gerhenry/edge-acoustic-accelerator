# edge-acoustic-accelerator

A tapeout-ready **analog accelerator** demo built with open-source EDA tools.
It performs **band-energy feature extraction → analog MAC → Winner-Take-All (WTA)**
classification for simple acoustic events (e.g., *clap*, *glass*, *speech*, *silence*).
Designed for SKY130/GF180 open PDKs and evaluation on a small MCU-based board.

This repository is a scaffold with folder structure, example stubs, and docs to help you kickstart design, tapeout, and lab demo.
